 MACHINE=xMx [DISTRO=xDx] bitbake mc:xMx:xIx
SDK building:
 MACHINE=xMx [DISTRO=xDx] bitbake -c populate_sdk mc:xMx:xIx

 , where
    xMx is machine {tppg2,sp7021-arm5,tppg1}
    xDx is distro {tps,tin}
    xIx is image name

Machines:
 "tppg2" is TPP gen 2 board (sp7021-SoC based)
 "sp7021-arm5" is firmware for TPPg2 coprocessor
 "tppg1" is TPP gen 1 board (discontinued)

Distros:
 "tps" is (default) Systemd enabled + WiFi/BT/usb + X11/Wayland
 "tin" is small rc-based test example

Images:
 "imgf-xboot" is TPPg2 SoC co-processor only code (Xboot + a926 FW)
 "img-tst-tini" (1) is small CLI systemd-only image example
 "img-tps-free" (2) = (1) + package management, gdb, tcf-agent
 "img-tps-base" (3) = (2) + Tibbo private apps
 "img-tps-repo" image to generate Tibbo packages repository
